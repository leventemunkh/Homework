Single page app made with React

The application consists of only one page, the Home page. On this page there are cards with information about the characters.
Unfortunately couldn't manage to create a Profile page where details about each character should've been shown. Instead of the Profile page I implemented a search bar,
where the user is able to search up any character from the given Rick and Morty API not just the 20 that is shwon on the home page.
